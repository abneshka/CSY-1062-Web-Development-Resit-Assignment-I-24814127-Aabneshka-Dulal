      <h1>Site Report</h1>

      <h2>Commencement</h2>
    <p>
    The whole report is the depiction of how the website is formed and what protocols are needed to make it stable. By including all the sections i.e. home, project, contact,videodemo and sitereport, a website is presented that is introduced as my portfolio website for the assignment. The webpage gives a subtle introduction of myself and includes information like email and phone number through which people can come in contact with me for various project developmant plans. The portfolio gives good insight about a basic introduction webpage of a person.

      <h2>Skill building journey</h2>

    <p>
   From the starting of these journey, I as an individual gotten lot from particularly these project which has helped me to build up my skills. Coding the assignment involved understanding of fundamental aspects of the webpage. I also learned how we can create a responsive webpage which means making webpage available in both desktop and mobile version. These kind of basic web development helps students to obtain understanding for basic aspects of development of the web page. The process of making such pages helps in better understanding of codes that we learn day to day life. When we start creating such small projects we can see vaious codes we learnt in class unfold before us. These helps us finnaly to understand what codes can be placed where and what can be done so that the codes are interlinked with each other. There may be some fault in creating the website but the things learnt by us students while developing our portfolio is greater than any teachings we can achieve. Hence, it is proved that self learning is the best type of learning and shape our knowledge in learning code by ourselves and creating such projects by practicing even harder. There is these saying that goes, "Formal education will make you a living but: self learning will make you a fortune" by Jim Rohn that proves learning is a lifelong process and you are your own teacher, you develop yourselves as you keep on educating yourselves.
